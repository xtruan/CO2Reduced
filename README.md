# CO2 Reduced Data Field
CO2 Reduced data field for Garmin ConnectIQ - https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/99c57ab8-724e-48dd-ad8a-b2afffb48cd0

Data field that displays the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) you have reduced by walking/biking/running vs. driving the same distance in a car. The app settings in Garmin Express or Garmin Connect allow you to configure the miles per (US) gallon to be specific to your own vehicle. The default is 25 MPG. The fuel type can also be configured between gasoline (petrol) and diesel. Gasoline is the default. The units can be changed between pounds and kilograms by editing the units option in device settings between metric and statute.

The amount of CO2 reduced during an activity is recorded and can be viewed on Garmin Connect.

Calculator values sourced from US EPA - https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gases-equivalencies-calculator-calculations-and-references
- 8,887 grams of CO2 per gallon of gasoline
- 10,180 grams of CO2 per gallon of diesel
